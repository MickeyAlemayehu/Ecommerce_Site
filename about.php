    <h2>ðŸ›’ About Us</h2> 
    <p>
      Welcome to our online shopping platform â€” a modern, user-friendly website created with passion, purpose, and innovation by a team of five Computer Science students.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are a group of tech enthusiasts who believe that technology can make shopping more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable for everyone. Our project was born from a shared vision in our university coursework, where we decided to turn a classroom idea into a real, working platform.
